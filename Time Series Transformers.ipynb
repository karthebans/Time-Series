    "Time series data often requires some preparation prior to being modeled with machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, differencing operations can be used to remove trend and seasonal structure from the sequence in order to simplify the prediction problem. Some algorithms, such as neural networks, prefer data to be standardized and/or normalized prior to modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any transform operations applied to the series also require a similar inverse transform to be applied on the predictions. This is required so that the resulting calculated performance measures are in the same scale as the output variable and can be compared to classical forecasting methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, you will discover how to perform and invert four common data transforms for time series data in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading this post, you will know:\n",
    " \n",
    "* How to transform and inverse the transform for four methods in Python.\n",
    "* Important considerations when using transforms on training and test datasets.\n",
    "* The suggested order for transforms when multiple operations are required on a dataset.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial is divided into three parts; they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transforms for Time Series Data\n",
    "2. Considerations for Model Evaluation\n",
    "3. Order of Data Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a quick look at each in turn and how to perform these transforms in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also review how to reverse the transform operation as this is required when we want to evaluate the predictions in their original scale so that performance measures can be compared directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there other transforms you like to use on your time series data for modeling with machine learning methods?\n",
    "Let me know in the comments below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Power Transform\n",
    "A power transform removes a shift from a data distribution to make the distribution more-normal (Gaussian).\n",
    "\n",
    "On a time series dataset, this can have the effect of removing a change in variance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular examples are the log transform (positive values) or generalized versions such as the Box-Cox transform (positive values) or the Yeo-Johnson transform (positive and negative values).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can implement the Box-Cox transform in Python using the boxcox() function from the SciPy library.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the method will numerically optimize the lambda value for the transform and return the optimal value.\n"

    "* Standardization is linear and should be performed on the sample after any nonlinear transforms and differencing.\n",
    "* Normalization is a linear operation but it should be the final transform performed to maintain the preferred scale.\n",
